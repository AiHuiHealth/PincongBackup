<span style="">如果我解释统一是如何好，恐怕也是徒劳，还要被骂五毛，那就换一种方式回答这个问题。</span>

<span style="">题主同样应该问问民主灯塔美国为什么有大一统的执念。</span><span style="">美国，是这么看待国家分裂的：</span>  

<span style="">With all fifty states offering petitions to the central government to leave the Union, the legality of secession is now front page news in the United States. Can a state legally secede from the Union? Many, including Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, suggest no. In a 2006 letter, available&nbsp;</span>[here](https://web.archive.org:443/web/20180529145400/http://www.theblaze.com/stories/there-is-no-right-to-secede-see-the-letter-where-justice-scalia-shoots-down-idea-of-leaving-the-union/)<span style="">, Scalia argued that a the question was not in the realm of legal possibility because 1) the United States would not be party to a lawsuit on the issue 2) the “constitutional” basis of secession had been “resolved by the Civil War,” and 3) there is no right to secede, as the Pledge of Allegiance clearly illustrates through the line “one nation, indivisible.”</span>

<span style="">末尾几句话翻译过来：</span>

<span style="">最高法院大法官Antonim Scalia的意见是，州无权独立，他曾说过原因有三：</span>

<span style="">1. 联邦将不会称为独立诉讼中的当事人。</span>

<span style="">2. 南北战争已经解决了宪法对分裂的基本原则。(译注：分裂等于另一次内战，南北战争的诸多结果中，最重要者即统一美国。)</span>

<span style="">3.&nbsp;</span><span style="">Pledge of Allegiance 明确注明 “一个国家，不可分割”</span>
