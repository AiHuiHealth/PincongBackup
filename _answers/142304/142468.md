美国财政部一位高级官员说,美国仍然对中国最近的货币贬值感到关切，并且说目前还不清楚财政部长姆努钦是否会在本星期的国际货币基金组织会议上与中国官员会晤。中国外交部发言人10月9日星期二否认中国利用人民币贬值来刺激出口。

美财政部官员星期一通过电话会议告诉媒体：“我们当然在密切关注人民币的走向。我们仍然对于最近的人民币贬值感到关切。”

这位官员说从更广泛的意义来说，美国关注的是中国放弃更倾向于市场经济的政策，继续依赖非市场机制，这些将影响宏观经济和贸易环境。 这位官员还说，财政部将在本星期公布的年中货币报告中阐述这些关注的问题，不过他拒绝透露报告的细节。

美国财政部长姆努钦7月份曾表示他密切关注中国是否有操纵货币币值的迹象。美国总统特朗普曾多次批评中国以货币贬值来增加贸易优势。

中国外交部发言人陆慷星期二说,中国“无意通过货币竞争性贬值来刺激出口，也不会把人民币汇率作为一个工具来应对一些不管是贸易还是其他经济领域的争端。” 他还批评这些说法不负责任，是毫无根据的猜测。

美国和中国目前正卷入一场贸易争端。华盛顿上个月向2千亿美元的中国商品增收关税，北京则向价值6百亿美元的美国产品增收关税进行报复。

U.S. Concerned About Chinese Yuan’s Recent Drop, Official Says By Saleha Mohsin October 8, 2018, 10:36 AM EDT Updated on October 9, 2018, 8:10 AM EDT

The Trump administration is concerned about the Chinese yuan’s depreciation as the Treasury Department weighs whether to name China a currency manipulator in a report due out next week, a senior Treasury official said Monday. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has faced pressure from the White House to formally designate China a currency manipulator in the report. The yuan has tumbled 9 percent against the dollar in the last six months in one of Asia’s worst performances, raising speculation that China has been deliberately weakening its currency as trade tensions with the U.S. have escalated. Read More: Here’s How Trump Can Formally Name China a Currency Manipulator The senior official said the U.S. is closely monitoring the Chinese currency and is concerned about the recent depreciation. The official didn’t provide further elaboration. The official was responding to a question during a briefing ahead of a visit Mnuchin will make this week to Bali, Indonesia, for a meeting of finance minsters and central bankers under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The official briefed reporters under condition of anonymity. The U.S. accusation was followed by the lowest yuan daily fixing in more than a year on Tuesday, with the central bank setting the reference rate weaker than 6.9 per dollar for the first time since May 2017. Declaring China to be a currency manipulator wouldn’t trigger any sanctions or other U.S. penalties, but it would escalate trade tensions, would likely upset markets and could pave the way for other actions down the road. Under a 1988 law, the Treasury is required to report to Congress twice a year on international economic conditions and exchange-rate policies. The Treasury must enter direct talks with a country deemed to be manipulating its currency, and also seek redress through the IMF. The last country labeled a manipulator was China, in 1994. Markets don’t need to worry too much on recent yuan fluctuations, and the yuan is still relatively strong because the dollar has strengthening quickly, PBOC adviser Liu Shijin wrote in an article published on the state-run Economic Daily on Monday. President Donald Trump accused China and the European Union of manipulating their currencies in a July tweet, saying the move are “taking away our big competitive edge.” China, the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower, while the U.S. is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day - taking away our big competitive edge. As usual, not a level playing field... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 20, 2018 — With assistance by Ben Bartenstein, Rita Nazareth, and Yinan Zhao (Updates with explanation of impact of labeling a country a currency manipulator starting in sixth paragraph.)
